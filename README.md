# ADB-to-USB-Converter
Project started on 18/02/18 to create a converter of the Apple Desktop Bus Protocol to the USB protocol. Due to many hardware issues, device was made to convert to PS2 instead for simplicity. Now that there is a better understanding of the USB protocol, there will be another attempt to finish it.
